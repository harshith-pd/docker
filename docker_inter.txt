Docker

--Networking
- Containers are interconnected to each other through a network established by connecting the ethernet port of the individual containers to the host system.
- the docker engine on initialisation creates a virtual ethernet link between the host and the docker called the docker0 bridge

Container Networking model:
- Sandbox : isolated machine level network settings like network-stack, routing tables, DNS settings etc 
- Endpoint : connects sandbox to the docker-engine network, provides portability to connect to different network drivers
- docker-engine Network : which then translates to the host network settings
